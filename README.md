# Personal Portfolio Website

A minimalist portfolio website built to showcase my projects and improve my frontend fundamentals.

## 🚀 Motivation

I wanted to create a dedicated space to present my work, while strengthening my understanding of core frontend development concepts. This project focuses on writing clean UI components, reusable styling patterns, and building a responsive layout from scratch.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – App routing, server-side rendering, and optimized performance
- **React** – Component-based UI architecture
- **TypeScript** – Strong typing for predictable code
- **Vanilla CSS** – Handcrafted styling with no UI framework to reinforce fundamentals

## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
